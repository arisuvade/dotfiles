# My Dotfiles for Arch Linux
This repository contains my dotfiles for my Arch Linux desktop. Dotfiles are configuration files that are typically hidden in Unix-like operating systems, and they control the behavior and appearance of various programs on your system.

## Features
These dotfiles include configurations for the following programs:

- i3 window manager
- polybar status bar
- rofi application launcher
- compton compositor
- zsh shell
